The following portfolio is to present my work to clients. My name is Parth Arora and I am a full time freelance photographer. I specialize in portrait and product photography. I have worked with several clients over the years and I have built this portfolio.

This portfolio was mainly designed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap (CSS Framework)

The whole project has been developed in Visual Studio Code IDE.
