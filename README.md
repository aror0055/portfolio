# final assignment - portfolio, mtm6201 Web Development II, F2021

The following portfolio is to present my work to clients. My name is Parth Arora and I am a full time freelance photographer. I specialize in portrait and product photography. I have worked with several clients over the years and I have built this portfolio.

## Brief description about my experience while creating this project:
This project was a good experience overall, I learnt a lot about boostrap and how to customize it according to the needs of the project. The main challenges I faced while doing this project were figuring out the spacing between grids and how to increase accessibility. I used trial and error method to figure it out and I was able to achieve desired results using this method.
